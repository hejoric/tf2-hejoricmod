# HejoricMod

🔥 A Team Fortress 2–inspired multiplayer mod built on [Source SDK 2013 Community Edition](https://github.com/Nbc66/source-sdk-2013-ce).  
This project is part learning experiment, part creative playground — a chance to dive into Source engine internals, custom gameplay mechanics, and multiplayer networking in C++.

## 🎮 Goals
- Learn and modify a large-scale C++ codebase (Source SDK)
- Experiment with new gameplay features (custom weapons, movement tweaks, balance changes)
- Modernize parts of the HUD/UI
- Explore multiplayer networking logic
- Build a unique, personal take on TF2-inspired gameplay
