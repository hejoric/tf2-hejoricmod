# HejoricMod

HejoricMod is my personal fork of the [Source SDK 2013 Community Edition](https://github.com/Nbc66/source-sdk-2013-ce).  
This project is focused on learning C++, exploring the Source engine, and experimenting with custom Team Fortress 2–style mods.  

The goal of HejoricMod is to create a lightweight, fun, and educational codebase that builds directly from the stable **master** branch of Source SDK 2013 CE.
